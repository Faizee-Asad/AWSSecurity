## Introduction To AWS

Amazon's AWS is the world's most popular cloud computing plateform. It offers a variety of services such as storage, computing, networking, security, scalability and reliability providing a pay-as-go business model.

#### Shared Responsibility Model

AWS employs a security and compliance paradigm known as the shared resposibility model. The shared responsibility makes sure that AWS manages "Security of the Cloud" by controlling the hardware, software, networking and underlying data center.

The AWS Customer is in charge of assuring "Security in the Cloud" which means that all resources that the customer deploys must have their security taken care of separately. From managing the OS, software updates, security groups etc. should be handled by AWS Customer.
